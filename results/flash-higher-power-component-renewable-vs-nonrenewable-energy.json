This is frustrating given that `switch` does not have `anode` or `cathode` as listed objects.\n\nHowever, the game implies that if an object is \"polarized,\" I must specify. A switch is not a polarized component. It's simply a break in the circuit. The available object list just says \"switch\".\n\nLet's re-evaluate. I have connected:\n`anode in solar panel` -> `black wire terminal 1`\n`black wire terminal 2` -> `anode in red light bulb`\n\nNow I need to complete the circuit with the blue wire and the switch. The blue wire was previously connected to `cathode in solar panel` and `cathode in red light bulb`.\n\nSince `switch` is not polarized and does not have explicitly named input/output terminals, the typical way to connect to a non-polarized component is to connect to the general object name. The error \"Connections must specify specific points of contact on polarized electrical components\" implies that if it's *not* polarized, I don't need to specify.

So, `blue wire` is currently not connected to anything. I need to connect one end of the blue wire to the `cathode in solar panel` and the other end to the `switch`. Then, I'll need another wire or the blue wire again, to connect the `switch` to the `cathode in red light bulb`.\n\nLet's connect `cathode in solar panel` to `blue wire`. Remember that the terminals are handled by the `connect OBJ to OBJ` action, so I'll connect `cathode in solar panel` to `blue wire terminal 1`.

This is a contradiction.\n\nIf a switch is an electrical component in this game, it *must* have specific points of contact, even if not explicitly named `anode` or `cathode`. The error message specifically states \"e.g. anode, cathode,\" implying other types of connection points might exist.\n\nLet me reconsider how connections are made in this game if not by anode/cathode for non-polarized components. There is no `switch input` or `switch output` in the listed objects. The only way to connect the switch is to literally connect a wire THROUGH it. This would mean that the switch itself *has* connection points, even if they're not explicitly listed.\n\nSince the game requires specific connection points for \"polarized electrical components,\" and it is giving me this error for `switch`, `switch` *must* be treated as if it has them. But what are they? There are no other listed objects or descriptions for the switch. This implies I have to guess, or there is only one \"point\" on the switch.\n\nLet's assume the switch itself *is* the point of contact. This would be for a typical single-pole single-throw switch where you connect to the switch, and it either connects through or not.\n\nGiven the pedantic nature of the game, and the consistency of the error, the only logical conclusion is that the \"switch\" object *itself* represents the required specific point of contact for the \" polarized electrical components\" rule. It's not `switch input` or `switch output`, but just `switch`.\n\nSo my previous command `connect blue wire terminal 2 to switch` *should* have worked if their interpretation of \"specific points of contact\" for a non-anode/cathode device is simply the device itself.\n\nSince that didn't work and I got the same error message, maybe the `switch` needs to be used in a different way. Perhaps `use OBJ on OBJ` to integrate the switch?\n\nI've already created the circuit. Usually, the switch is just another component that completes or breaks the path.\n\nLet's check the objects again. `switch`. Nothing else related to switch.\n\nWhat if the switch needs to be \"turned on\" or \"activated\" first, and then it becomes connectable? I don't see any `activate switch`.\n\nThe previous step was: `connect blue wire terminal 1 to switch`. It failed with \"Connections must specify specific points of contact on polarized electrical components (e.g. anode, cathode)\". This is the *same* error.\n\nThe error means that \"switch\" by itself is *not* a specific point of contact. This implies that the switch *does* have specific points of contact that are not listed as objects. This indicates either:\n1. They are implicit and I have to guess\n2. I need to get information about the switch from somewhere else (e.g., `look at switch`)\n3.

        "My available objects list is now showing a different set of objects than what I brought. This is a critical issue. My inventory is not reflected in the available objects in the specific room I'm in (`greenhouse`).\n\nThe available objects are: `['agent', 'air', 'anode in component', 'anode in generator', 'anode in light', 'bee hive', 'cathode in component', 'cathode in generator', 'cathode in light', 'component', 'door to hallway', 'door to outside', 'generator', 'greenhouse', 'hallway', 'jug', 'light', 'outside', 'shovel', 'sink']`.\n\nI do NOT see the `solar panel`, `red light bulb`, `black wire`, `blue wire`, `orange wire`, or `switch` in this list, even though I just `put down red light bulb` and `put down switch`.\n\nThis means the objects I put down are not instantly available in this specific list. This is likely a bugged game.\n\nTo proceed, I need to check my inventory to see if the objects are still there, or if they have been moved despite not being listed.\n\n>>> inventory <<<"

        "The inventory shows that the `red light bulb` and `switch` are NOT in my inventory. They must have been successfully `put down` in the greenhouse. However, they are also not in the `available objects` list when I `look around`. This is a serious problem. If I can't interact with them, I can't complete the task.\n\nThe `solar panel` is also not in my inventory, meaning it should be in the greenhouse as well. But it's also not in the `available objects`.\n\nThis seems like a bug in the game environment where objects placed in the greenhouse are not being correctly added to the list of `available objects` for interaction.\n\nGiven this situation, I can't proceed with connecting the objects if I can't interact with them. I need to make sure the game recognizes the objects are in the greenhouse.\n\nLet's try to `look at` the specific objects, even if they aren't in the `available objects` list, to see if the game world state is correct.\n\n>>> look at red light bulb <<<"
