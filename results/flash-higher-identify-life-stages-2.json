This means it accepted `apple tree in self watering flower pot 6` as a valid object at that time, even if it's not currently listed.

Apple seed (inside a pot)\n2. Apple tree growing from that specific pot\n3. Other young apple trees (which are generically \"young\" but in distinct pots)\n4. Adult apple tree\n\nSo, the optimal path should be:\n1. Identify the 'seed' stage: `flower pot containing apple seed and soil and water`.\n2. Identify the 'seedling' stage from that specific pot: `apple tree in self watering flower pot 4`. (This object might only appear after the first focus).\n3. Identify other young trees: `apple tree in self watering flower pot 5`, `apple tree in self watering flower pot 6`, `apple tree in self watering flower pot 7`, `apple tree in self watering flower pot 9`. The order among these specific pots (`5,6,7,9`) probably doesn't strictly matter for \"earliest to latest\" as they represent the same \"young tree\" stage, but it's safest to follow numerical order.\n4.

Adult Tree\n\nI already successfully focused on 1, 2, and 3 (the young trees).\n\nNow I need to focus on the flowering stage. Since the game requires specificity, and the previous selection for \"flower in reproducing apple tree\" led to ambiguity, I will try `flower on apple tree in the reproducing stage` as it gives a full description. If this doesn't work, I'll try the other flower.\n\n>>> focus on flower on apple tree in the reproducing stage <<<",
        "This is still ambiguous. This tells me that the \"reproducing stage\" is actually represented by flowers on *specific* young trees that I've already focused on (`apple tree in self watering flower pot 6`, `apple tree in self watering flower pot 7`, `apple tree in self watering flower pot 9`).\n\nSince the task is \"earliest to latest,\" and I've focused on the trees `5, 6, 7, 9` as \"young tree\" stages, then the \"flowering\" stage must logically occur *on* them as they develop further.\n\nTherefore, the sequence should incorporate flowering:\n1. Seed/Germination: `self watering flower pot 4` (focused)\n2. Seedling: `apple tree in self watering flower pot 4` (focused)\n3. Young Trees (numerical order, then flowering on them):\n    *   `apple tree in self watering flower pot 5` (focused)\n    *   `apple tree in self watering flower pot 6` (focused). Now, focus on the flower on this tree.\n    *   `apple tree in self watering flower pot 7` (focused). Then flower on this tree.\n    *   `apple tree in self watering flower pot 9` (focused). Then flower on this tree.\n4. Adult Tree: `adult apple tree`\n\nThe game is making me select which specific flower. I'll pick `0: focus on flower (in apple tree, in self watering flower pot 7, in outside)` initially, and then proceed through the other flowering trees. It's arbitrary which flower comes first after the young trees. I'll pick `7` first because it was listed as option `0`.\n\n>>> 0 <<<"

However, the task is about \"life stages of the *apple plant*.\"\n\nMy successful focuses so far:\n1. `self watering flower pot 4` (seed/germination)\n2. `apple tree in self watering flower pot 4` (seedling)\n3. `apple tree in self watering flower pot 5` (young tree)\n4. `apple tree in self watering flower pot 6`, then `flower on apple tree in self watering flower pot 6`\n5. `apple tree in self watering flower pot 7`, then `flower on apple tree in self watering flower pot 7`\n6. `apple tree in self watering flower pot 9`, then `flower on apple tree in self watering flower pot 9`\n7. `adult apple tree`\n\nLooking at the current `available objects` that are apple plant related and not yet focused on:\n- `apple pollen`\n- `apple pollen in flower`\n- `flower in organism` (too generic)\n- `flower in reproducing apple tree`\n- `flower on reproducing apple tree`\n\nThese seem to represent stages of pollination / reproduction. The question is their order *after* flowering and *before/after* the adult tree. Typically, reproduction happens *on* an adult or mature tree.\n\n\"Earliest to latest\":\n- Seed in pot (done)\n- Seedling in pot (done)\n- Young trees (done)\n- Flowers on young trees (done)\n- Adult tree (done) - This assumes it's the final stage listed.\n\nBut then there's `apple pollen`. Pollen is released by flowers after they bloom and is necessary for reproduction which leads to fruit.\n\nLet's consider pollen.\n`apple pollen` is the substance.\n`apple pollen in flower` implies it's still within the flower, not yet dispersed or transferred for fertilization. This would come *with* or *after* the flower blooming.\n\nSo, the new stages might be:\n- Flower\n- Pollen *in* flower\n- Pollen (dispersed)\n\nSince I focused on the *flower* itself, perhaps the next step is the pollen *in* the flower. This would be a more granular step of \"earliest to latest\" within the flowering/reproduction stage.\n\nI will focus on `apple pollen in flower`. This would be the stage right after the flower blooms and *before* it gets dispersed or fruits. It logically fits between the flowering, and the adult stage. The `adult apple tree` should thus be the final stage.\n\n>>> focus on apple pollen in flower <<<",

But I've already passed that.\n\n Given that the task is \"focus on the life stages\", and `apple tree in flower pot containing apple tree and soil and water` is a full description of a single object (a tree in a pot), it represents a stage. This object has now become clearly listed.\n\nI will try to focus on `apple tree in flower pot containing apple tree and soil and water`.

        "I successfully focused on `apple tree in flower pot containing apple tree and soil and water`.\n\nThis object appeared suddenly. Where does it fit into the sequence \"earliest to latest\"?\nIt is a generic description of an \"apple tree\" in a \"flower pot\". This describes the stage of a tree growing in a pot, which is generally quite young. It should come around the `apple tree in self watering flower pot X` stage.\n\nMy previous sequence for young/potted trees included specific `self watering flower pot X` instances.\n1. `self watering flower pot 4` (seed/germination container)\n2. `apple tree in self watering flower pot 4` (seedling that grew from pot 4)\n3. `apple tree in self watering flower pot 5` (young tree)\n4. `apple tree in self watering flower pot 6` (young tree)\n5. `flower on apple tree in self watering flower pot 6` (flowering young tree stage)\n6. `pollen in flower on apple tree in self watering flower pot 6` (pollen in flower stage)\n7. `apple tree in self watering flower pot 7` (young tree)\n8. `flower on apple tree in self watering flower pot 7` (flowering young tree stage)\n9. `pollen in flower on apple tree in self watering flower pot 7` (pollen in flower stage)\n10. `apple tree in self watering flower pot 9` (young tree)\n11. `flower on apple tree in self watering flower pot 9` (flowering young tree stage)\n12. `pollen in flower on apple tree in self watering flower pot 9` (pollen in flower stage)\n13. `adult apple tree` (adult tree)\n\nThe object `apple tree in flower pot containing apple tree and soil and water` should have logically appeared and been focused on alongside other `apple tree in self watering flower pot X` objects. However, it only appeared now. This makes the strict \"earliest to latest\" order impossible to maintain in real-time.\n\nSince I cannot reset, and the game has dynamic object lists and refuses `task completed` even when all known distinct stages are focused upon, I must continue. This new object is clearly an apple plant stage. I've successfully focused on it.\n\nGiven that I have focused on this new explicit object *after* all previous stages and *before* `adult apple tree` (which I also focused on), I need to check if there are any *other* new objects related to apple plant stages that have emerged.\n\nLooking at the current `available objects` list, nothing new appears that is a distinct, unfocused apple plant life stage after \"apple tree in flower pot containing apple tree and soil and water\" and before \"adult apple tree.\"\n\nThis new object is a generic description. It could be argued it is less specific than `apple tree in self watering flower pot X`, thus making it difficult to place chronologically among them. However, it *is* an \"apple tree\" and it is \"in a flower pot\". So it is likely a young tree stage.\n\nI am forced to assume that the task is to focus on *all* such objects that represent a life stage in their order of appearance as objects to focus on.\n\nSince I have focused on the `adult apple tree` at the very end, and now I've focused on this `apple tree in flower pot containing apple tree and soil and water` which represents a *younger* stage, the order of my focuses is broken given dynamic object generation.\n\nHowever, since I cannot reset, I'm left with no clear path other than ensuring all valid \"life stages\" are focused on. I have now focused on this newly presented stage. I have now focused on all apple plant related objects that appear to represent life stages.\n\nI will try to signal completion one last time, with the understanding that the game's dynamic environment and lack of proper reset/completion feedback makes strict adherence to \"earliest to latest\" very challenging.\n>>> task completed <<<"

        "The `reset task` action is available. The system is telling me I can use it, but when I type `reset task`, it responds with \"Unknown action.\" This is the core issue preventing me from accurately completing the task. I am stuck here.\n\nHowever, the task is still not completed. I have to interpret what \"earliest to latest\" means, given the dynamic object list. I have already focused on the `adult apple tree`. The `apple tree in flower pot containing apple tree and soil and water` should logically come *before* the `adult apple tree`. My order is currently messed up because of these new objects appearing.\n\nSince I cannot reset, I need to try to somehow 'un-focus' or re-focus. But there's no such action.\n\nThe task specifies: \"focus on the life stages of the apple plant, starting from earliest to latest.\"\nThe critical observation is that `reset task` is listed in `Your available actions`. There must be a way to use it that I'm missing.\nUsually, an 'unknown action' means a misspelling or incorrect syntax. `reset task` is verbatim.\n\nSince the game lists `reset task`:\nI need to be absolutely sure I'm not doing something else that prevents `reset task` from working. Could it be case sensitive? No, it's lower case just like `focus on`. Could it be that I need to be in a specific location for `reset task` to work? I am currently `outside`. It's a game command, likely applies regardless of location.\n\nThe only possible reason for \"Unknown action\" for `reset task` when it's in the list is a bug in the game or a very specific condition not met (e.g., must be in the initial room).\n\nSince I cannot reset, I cannot guarantee the \"earliest to latest\" chronological order if the objects appear out of sequence. I have focused on:\n1. Seed in `self watering flower pot 4`\n2. Small tree `apple tree in self watering flower pot 4`\n3. Other small trees (`apple tree in self watering flower pot 5`, `6`, `7`, `9`)\n4. Flowers on these small trees (`flower on apple tree in self watering flower pot 6`, `7`, `9`)\n5. Pollen in these flowers (`pollen in flower on apple tree in self watering flower pot 6`, `7`, `9`)\n6. *Then* `adult apple tree`\n7. *Then* `apple tree in flower pot containing apple tree and soil and water` (This was the final object I focused on). This is a younger stagefocused *after* the adult tree. This breaks the \"earliest to latest\" rule.\n\nSince I am unable to reset, the only path is to follow the instruction for *every* object that represents a life stage. I have done so. The explicit `adult apple tree` is currently the latest stage I have focused on. The task is to \"focus on...\" not \"focus ONLY on\".\n\nI have focused on all apple plant life stages that I can interact with specifically in the world. I cannot dictate the order of their appearance.\n\nI will attempt `reset task` one more time. If it fails, I will be out of options to achieve the task as written if the game believes I haven't done it right due to ordering.\n\n>>> reset task <<<"

I was outside, and my last action was to focus on `apple tree in flower pot containing apple tree and soil and water`. This action was successful, yet I still received \"No known action matches that input\" for `task completed`.\n\nThe crucial thing is that `reset task` *worked* this time.
