No, the list of available objects explicitly shows \"door to kitchen\".\n\nThe critical detail might be the \"remember, your task is to...\" section.

However, the task says \"move it to the red box in the kitchen\", so I will eventually need to be *in* the kitchen.\n\nGiven that \"open door to kitchen\" is consistently rejected, there must be a subtle reason. I will try to `go` to the Kitchen directly, as if the `door to kitchen` itself is not the correct interactable object, but the Kitchen is a destination.

This implies that `kitchen` is not the correct object for `go`, or that `go` is not how you move through a door.\n\nWhat if the `open` command refers to the `door` and after it's opened, *then* I can `go` to the `kitchen`?

This specific phrasing, along with \"door to kitchen\" in the object list, might mean that \"door to kitchen\" is the correct object.\n\nIs it possible that \"open door to kitchen\" is the correct *action*, but the game expects something more specific from me, or the state is wrong? No, the game states it's closed.\n\nCould the syntax be like `open the door to kitchen`? No, that's adding words.\n\nLet's assume `open door to kitchen` should work, and the error is from *my* understanding. Given the pedantic nature, maybe it's case sensitive or has an invisible character? No, that's improbable.\n\nThe previous interaction stated `No known action matches that input`. This is the system's way of saying \"what you typed is not a valid action or object combination\".\n\nI will try `open door to kitchen` again, but this time I will assume there's a problem with my text input and ensure it's precisely typed.
