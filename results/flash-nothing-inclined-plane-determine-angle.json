To determine which has the *shallowest* angle, I need a more precise measurement or a way to differentiate between them if they are indeed very close.\n\nSince the block slid 5% on both, it suggests they are very similar. If I had a way to measure the angle directly, that would be ideal. However, I don't see any tools for that.\n\nPerhaps the \"5% down the plane\" is a rounded number, and one is slightly less than the other. I need to find a way to get a more precise reading or a different method to compare them.\n\nI will try to \"focus on\" each inclined plane to see if there's more information.
