Looking at the seeds I have:\n- A square blue unknown E seed\n- A round brown unknown E seed\n\nIn many cases in plant genetics, brown/darker pigments are often dominant over blue/lighter pigments because brown pigments usually result from the presence of certain compounds, while blue often results from the absence or modification of those compounds.\n\nHowever, without breeding data showing the inheritance pattern (like F1 and F2 generations), I cannot be completely certain.
