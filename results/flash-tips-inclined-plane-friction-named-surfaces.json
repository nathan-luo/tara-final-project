I have tried many combinations of \"use\", \"move\", \"activate\", \"pick up\", and \"put down\" with the block, inclined plane, and stopwatch. The electrical components are still listed, which is a distraction.\n\nThe game is pedantic. I need to find the exact phrasing.\n\nLet's re-examine the \"use OBJ on OBJ\" action. I have tried \"use block on inclined plane\" and \"use inclined plane on block\". Both failed. I have also tried \"use stopwatch on block\" and \"use stopwatch on inclined plane\".

The block is on the inclined plane. I need to make the block slide.\n\nWhat if the \"use\" action is meant to be used with the inclined plane, and the block is implicitly involved, and the stopwatch is also implicitly involved?\n\nI will try to \"use\" the inclined plane with a cloth surface.
