The *cup containing water* is an object.\nIs it possible the game means \"change the state of matter of *something identified as water*\"?\n\nI started with `cup containing water`.\nIf I focus on `cup containing water` again, maybe it implies the game wants me to change *that specific cup's contents*?\n\nThe state of matter of the water in \"cup containing water\" has changed to steam. The object is *now* `cup containing steam`. So, the state of the *object's contents* changed.\n\nPossible interpretations of \"change the state of matter of water\":\n1. Change *any* water's state (done once, water to steam).\n2. Change the state of water *from* water *to* ice or steam (done, water to steam).\n3. Change the state of *all* water in the room (not applicable, there is only that one cup).\n4. Change the state of the *object* labeled water (there is no object labeled just \"water\").\n\nLet's go back to the original `cup containing water` that I found. I have changed it to `cup containing steam`.\n\nWhat if I need to change it to *ice*? Since steam is a gas, and water is a liquid, changing it to ice would be a *different* state change.\n\nI will try to change the `cup containing steam` to `cup containing ice`.\nFirst, I need to pick up the `cup containing steam`.\n\n>>> pick up cup containing steam <<<"
