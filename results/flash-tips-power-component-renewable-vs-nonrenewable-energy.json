The error message \"Connections must specify specific points of contact on polarized electrical components (e.g. anode, cathode)\" is confusing because a switch is typically unpolarized. However, the game is being pedantic.\n\nLooking at the available objects, I see `switch` but no `switch terminal 1` or `switch terminal 2`. This implies that the `switch` itself is the \"point of contact\".\n\nLet's re-read the error message carefully: \"Connections must specify specific points of contact on unpolarized electrical components (e.g. terminal 1, terminal 2)\". This was the error I got when I tried to connect to `anode in solar panel` without specifying `terminal 1` or `terminal 2` on the wire.\n\nThe *switch* is an unpolarized component. So, it should have `terminal 1` and `terminal 2`. But they are not listed in the available objects. This is a contradiction.\n\nHowever, the previous error message \"No known action matches that input\" when I tried `connect black wire terminal 2 to switch terminal 1` suggests that `switch terminal 1` is not a valid object name.\n\nLet's assume the game expects me to connect to the `switch` object itself, and it will implicitly handle the terminals. But then the error \"Connections must specify specific points of contact on polarized electrical components (e.g. anode, cathode)\" doesn't make sense for a switch.\n\nLet's try to connect the `black wire terminal 2` to the `switch` as if the `switch` itself is the point of contact. This is what I tried before and got the \"Connections must specify specific points of contact on polarized electrical components (e.g. anode, cathode)\" error. This error message is misleading for a switch.\n\nLet's look at the available objects again. I see `switch`. I don't see `switch terminal 1` or `switch terminal 2`.\n\nWhat if the switch is a \"polarized\" component in this game's logic, even if it's not in real life? That seems unlikely.\n\nLet's try to connect the `black wire` to the `switch`. This is what I did before and it failed.\n\nThe game is being very specific about \"points of contact\". If `switch terminal 1` and `switch terminal 2` are not listed, then how do I connect to the switch?\n\nPerhaps the switch is not meant to be connected directly to a wire terminal, but rather the wire itself. No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nLet's try to connect the `black wire` to the `switch`. This is what I tried before and it failed.\n\nLet's try to connect `black wire terminal 2` to `switch`. This is what I tried before and it failed.\n\nThe error message \"Connections must specify specific points of contact on polarized electrical components (e.g. anode, cathode)\" is the key. It implies that the `switch` *is* considered a polarized component in this game, or that the game is giving a generic error message. If it's polarized, it should have an anode and cathode. But it doesn't.\n\nThis is a very tricky part of the game. The game is pedantic, but also has inconsistencies in its error messages or object naming.\n\nLet's try to connect the `black wire` to the `switch`. This is what I tried before and it failed.\n\nLet's try to connect `black wire terminal 2` to `switch`. This is what I tried before and it failed.\n\nWhat if the switch is not meant to be connected with wires, but rather \"used\" on the circuit? No, that doesn't make sense for a circuit.\n\nLet's assume the game is being literal about \"specific points of contact\". If `switch terminal 1` and `switch terminal 2` are not listed, then I cannot connect to them.\n\nCould the switch be a \"component\" that has an anode and cathode? The list of objects includes `anode in component` and `cathode in component`. This is a possibility! If the `switch` is a `component`, then it would have an anode and cathode.\n\nLet's try to connect `black wire terminal 2` to `anode in switch`.
