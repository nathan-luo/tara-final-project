Nothing that obvious.\nWhat did I miss?\n\nCould the \"sink\" object itself actually *be* the water once activated, but only if something *else* is done to it? The \"dunk\" action suggests it's empty.\n\nWhat about:\n- The \"bowl\"? It's currently empty, as it's not listed \"containing X\".\n- The \"soap\"? Unlikely to contain water.\n- The \"lighter\"? For combustion, but I need water first.\n- The \"thermometer\"? For measuring temperature, but not for getting water.\n\nCould I get water from *outside*? There is a \"door to the outside (that is closed)\". Perhaps there's a well or a pond out there. Given the stringency of the game, I should try to exhaust possibilities in the current room first.\n\nWhat about obscure ways \"water\" might be represented?\n- \"Air\"? Could it contain water vapor that I need to condense somehow? This seems too complex for a standard game action.\n- \"Apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\", \"potato\"? These contain water, but usually you don't \"boil\" them as sources of water for the task. You might \"eat\" them, but not boil them for water.\n\nI am forced to conclude that either:\n1. I am consistently misinterpreting \"activate sink\" or some other kitchen object interaction.\n2. The water is indeed outside.\n\nLet's reconsider the sink entirely. \"The sink is now activated.\" \"The sink does not contain any liquids to dunk into.\" \"Inside the sink is nothing.\"\n\nThis is contradictory. How can an activated sink contain nothing?\nMy intuition says an \"activated sink\" *should* have water.\n\nPerhaps I need to *take* water from the sink explicitly?\nIs there a \"take water from sink\" action? No, the actions are listed.\n\nWhat if \"activate\" means turning on the faucet, and I need to interact with the *faucet* itself, which isn't listed as an object? That seems too subtle.\n\nLet's reconsider what \"dunk\" requires. \"The sink does not contain any liquids to dunk into.\" This means \"sink\" is not a liquid source like a bucket of water.\n\nWhat if I need to use the \"metal pot\" *on* the sink?\nThe metal pot and other cups are empty now.\nI still have the glass cup in my inventory.\n\nLet's try a different interaction with the sink. What if \"activate sink\" actually *fills* the sink over time? That would be strange without any feedback.\n\nI am operating under the assumption that \"water\" is an explicit object I need to identify and then transfer. If water isn't an explicit object, but rather a *property* of the sink, then I need to find a way to perform an action that treats the sink as a source of water.\n\nThe \"pour OBJ in OBJ\" action is available. I've tried \"pour sink in glass cup\", which said \"sink is not moveable\".\nIf water isn't an explicit object to pour, what if I can *fill* a container directly from a source?\n\"fill OBJ\" is not an action.\n\nThis is a text simulation game. There MUST be a way to get water.\nThe prompt mentions: \"For compounds without a boiling point, combusting the substance is also acceptable.\" This means I need to find *something* to boil.\n\nWhat if the \"air\" itself contains somehow water that I can extract? Highly unlikely.\n\nI will try one more interaction with the sink, focusing on the *water* that I believe *should* be there, even if not an explicit object.\nIf the sink is \"activated\" and should have water, then `use glass cup on sink` is how one would typically fill a cup in a text game. I tried this before and it said \"I'm not sure how to use the glass cup.\"\n\nThis implies a specific verb or action is required.\nMaybe \"get water from sink\"? This is not a listed action.\n\nSince I am told \"the sink does not contain any liquid\", despite \"activating\" it, my interpretation of \"activate sink\" must be wrong. I am assuming it enables water flow *into the sink basin*. If it does not, then I still need to find water elsewhere.\n\nGiven the constraints, I will have to move outside.\nThere is a \"door to the outside\".\n\n>>> open door to outside <<<"
