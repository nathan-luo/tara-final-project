No, it's just a shovel.\n\nCould it be that the \"soil in flower pot 1\" is not the correct target, but the \"flower pot 1\" itself?\nI tried `put down apple seed in flower pot 1` earlier and it said \"No known action matches that input.\"\n\nThis is a critical block. I cannot proceed without planting.\nLet's consider the task description once more. \"Your task is to grow a apple. This will require growing several plants, and them being crosspollinated to produce fruit. Seeds can be found in the kitchen.\"\n\nIt does not specify *how* to plant.\n\nI will try one more approach with the shovel, focusing on the *action* of digging itself rather than the item. What if the shovel is an *interactive object* rather than just an item to be used *on* something?\n\nBut the available actions are `use OBJ on OBJ`. So that implies using the shovel *on* the soil.\n\nCould it be that I need to *take* soil in some way? No, there is no \"take\" action listed.\n\nPerhaps I can manipulate the flower pot itself. `activate`, `deactivate`, `open`, `close`... none of these apply to the flower pot for planting.\n\nI will attempt a highly specific phrasing for planting with the shovel, even though I doubt it will work given prior failures. The game is pedantic.\n\n`use shovel to plant apple seed in soil in flower pot 1` - this is too verbose and unlikely to match a direct action.\n\nI will try: `plant apple seed in soil in flower pot 1`. Though 'plant' is not in the action list, sometimes games have hidden actions.\nNo, that's not going to work.\n\nHow about breaking down the `use` action? Maybe I apply the seed to the soil first, then use the shovel to cover it?\n`use apple seed on soil in flower pot 1` resulted in \"I'm not sure how to use the apple seed.\"\n\nWhat if I need to put the seed *on* the soil first without aiming for planting, and then do something with the shovel?\nI did `put down apple seed` which put it directly on the floor.\n\nThis is a guessing game for the correct verb. The only verbs that seem relevant are `use`, `put down`, `move`.\n\nLet's imagine the intended action is `plant`. If so, how would it be phrased in this game's grammar?\n`plant apple seed`? `plant apple seed in flower pot 1`?\n\nCould there be a hint in the object descriptions themselves?\n`flower pot 1 (with some soil in it)` - implies the soil is already in the pot, ready to use.\n\nI will re-read the initial prompt and rules. \"You must be read EVERY detail and be VERY specific on actions and follow the task specification WORD BY WORD.\"\n\nThe task doesn't give any hints on *how* to plant.\n\nI am forced to try combinations of `use`, `put`, and `move` again.\nWhat if `use shovel on flower pot 1` does something to the pot to make it receptive? Doesn't make sense.\n\nI will pick one of the options from the \"Ambiguous request\" that was given earlier as a last resort, just in case the system was expecting a specific *number* for a *specific* action even if the general action was deemed unusable later.\nHowever, it already told me \"I'm not sure how to use the apple seed\" after I selected option 2.\n\nThis is a true block.

This implies the water was *part of* the jug, and when I picked up the jug, the water attribute disappeared.\n\nThis is a critical flaw. If I cannot find or generate water, I cannot grow the apple. The game has no \"fill\" or \"get water\" action.\n\nThis means I must restart the task, and this time, *not* pick up the jug before I attempt to pour water from it.

The `reset task` command did not return me to the initial state (hallway), but rather reset the \"goal progress and focus\" while keeping me in the last room I was in. This is a crucial distinction. The `jug` is no longer in the greenhouse. This means the original `jug` and its `water` are gone from the game world.\n\nThis further complicates achieving the goal. I *must* find a water source to grow the apple. Since \"jug (containing water)\" was the only water source, and `reset task` does not put objects back, I cannot fulfill the task if the water is permanently removed.\n\nThis must mean there *is* another source of water I missed, or the game is designed to force a full game restart (not just `reset task`). The description of the sink \"turned off\" with \"nothing in it\" explicitly suggests it could produce water if turned on.\n\nLet's assume there's a way to turn on the faucet in the sink in the kitchen or greenhouse.\nIn the greenhouse, I have a sink.

This means I do not have a container to fill with water from the sink.\n\nThis means I cannot get water. This is a dead end. The `reset task` does not fully reset the game state if objects like the jug disappear.\n\nThe only way to proceed is if there's a *new* container in the greenhouse, or if the flower pots themselves can be filled with water.\n\nLet's look at the available objects again. `flower pot 1 (containing soil)`, `flower pot 2 (containing soil)`, `flower pot 3 (containing soil)`. These are containers.\n\nI will try to `pour` water *into* one of the flowerpots from the *sink*.

The `reset task` command was ineffective in restoring the game state.
