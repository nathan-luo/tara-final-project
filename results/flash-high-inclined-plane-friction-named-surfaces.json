If neither \"activate\" nor \"use\" nor \"focus on\" the inclined plane directly causes the block to slide, I need to look for a way to *make* the block slide.\n\nThe previous attempts to use the block on the inclined plane (e.g., `use block on inclined plane with a paper surface`) were met with \"I'm not sure how to use the wood block.\" This suggests that \"use\" might not be the right verb for this interaction.\n\nWhat if \"move OBJ to OBJ\" does more than just place it?

The game is pedantic; it means exactly what it says.\n\nConsider the \"Available actions\" and \"Available objects\". There is a \"stopwatch\".\nPerhaps I need to *measure* something.

But there is `put down OBJ`. If I pick up the block, and then `put down block` on the inclined plane, would that cause it to slide?\n\nI already have the block on the paper inclined plane.

If the block doesn't slide, it means there's enough friction to prevent it from sliding down the incline.\n\nGiven the previous unsuccessful attempts to make it slide, I will assume, for now, that if the game does not explicitly state that the block is sliding, it means it is *not* sliding. If it is not sliding, despite being on an inclined plane, that implies high friction.\n\nLet's assume the paper surface has high friction (block not sliding). Now I need to test the cloth surface.\n\nFirst, I need to get the block off the paper inclined plane.

Based on my previous experience with the paper surface, if the block were sliding, the game would likely provide some feedback (e.g., \"The block slides down the inclined plane.\").\n\nSince there is no mention of the block sliding down the cloth surface, I conclude that it is not sliding. This means the cloth surface also has high friction, preventing the block from sliding.\n\nGiven that neither the paper nor the cloth inclined plane caused the block to slide when simply placed on them, it implies that both surfaces have sufficient friction to prevent sliding at their current inclination.\n\nHowever, the task is to determine which has the *most* friction. If neither causes sliding, I don't have a direct comparison using this method. This points to a flaw in my assumption that \"no feedback means no sliding.\"\n\nA common experiment for friction on an inclined plane involves *adjusting the angle* until the block just begins to slide. The steeper the angle needed, the more friction. However, there is no action to \"adjust the angle\" or \"tilt\" the inclined plane.\n\nSince the task implies a comparative experiment, and the game is pedantic, I need to rethink.\nThe \"stopwatch\" is an available object. This strongly suggests that I should be *measuring time* for something to happen. If I have to measure time, then the block *must* slide.\n\nSince placing the block doesn't cause it to slide, could there be another action that initiates the slide?\nI tried `activate inclined plane` - it failed.\nI tried `use block on inclined plane` - it failed.\n\nWhat if I need to move the block from one *end* of the inclined plane to the other?\n\"move OBJ to OBJ\" places the object *on* the target. It doesn't specify top or bottom.\n\nThe hint about \"available objects\" includes `stopwatch`. This implies timing. What if one of the hidden \"properties\" of the inclined planes is that one angle is *just steep enough* for the block *only* to slide on the lower friction surface?\n\nLet me try a different approach. The problem asks me to \"determine which of the two inclined planes (paper, cloth) has the most friction.\" And then \"After completing your experiment, focus on the inclined plane with the most friction.\"\n\nIf one doesn't slide and the other does, then the one that doesn't slide has more friction.\nIf both slide, the one that slides slower or less distance has more friction.\nIf neither slides, then I can't differentiate them by simply placing a block.\n\nThe game is not giving me any visual or textual cues about sliding or not sliding, beyond what I've tried.\nWhat if `focus on inclined plane` *after* the block is on it, gives me some information? I tried this before and it didn't give me info.\n\nLet's assume the game is more sophisticated than I'm currently understanding. The goal is to determine.\n\nCould it be that the act of \"moving\" the block to the inclined plane is the \"experiment\" and the game will tell me if it slides only *after* I've moved it to *both*?\nNo, that doesn't make sense. The game is usually very specific.\n\nCould the \"stopwatch\" be used to *measure* how quickly the block slides? But how do I make it slide?\n\nThis implies there *must* be an action that causes the block to slide.\nWhat about `put down block`? I previously placed it using `move block to inclined plane`.

This means `put down` places the object *where I am*, not *on a specific target*.\n\nThis implies that to place the block *on* the inclined plane, `move OBJ to OBJ` is the correct (and only) way. And `move block to inclined plane with a paper surface` does not cause sliding automatically.\n\nSo, if placing the block doesn't cause sliding, and there's no \"release\" or \"tilt\" action, what else can I do?\n\nThe task doesn't state they slide *at all*. It states to \"determine which has the most friction\".\nIf the block never slides on either, then both have high friction. How to compare which has *most* friction?\n\nGiven the objects available, specifically the `stopwatch`, indicates some form of timing. If an object does not slide, you cannot time it.\nThis implies two possibilities:\n1. They *do* slide, but the game is very subtle in its feedback.\n2. I need to trigger the slide in a way I haven't discovered yet.\n\nLet's revisit the prompt. \"Your task is to determine which of the two inclined planes (paper, cloth) has the most friction.\"\n\nWhat if I need to move *something else* on the inclined planes?

Like `activate stopwatch`?\n\nConsider the common physics experiment. You put a block on an inclined plane. If it doesn't slide, you increase the angle until it does. If it doesn't slide, it means there's too much friction for the current angle. If it slides, it means there's less friction than what is needed to hold it at that angle.\n\nSince I cannot adjust the angle, the only way to compare is if one slides and the other does not, *or* if they slide at different rates.\n\nI am going to assume the problem expects me to cause the block to slide and measure speed.\nHow else could I make the block slide?\n\nWhat if the \"inclined plane\" refers to specific points, like \"top of inclined plane\" or \"bottom of inclined plane\"?\nThe game only lists \"inclined plane with a paper surface\" and \"inclined plane with a cloth surface\".\n\nPerhaps the intended action is related to the `stopwatch`.
