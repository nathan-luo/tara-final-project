Here are the results:\n\n- Wood block on paper inclined plane: approximately 6% down the plane\n- Wood block on cloth inclined plane: approximately 5% down the plane\n\nSince the block slid further down the paper inclined plane (6%) compared to the cloth inclined plane (5%), this means the cloth surface has MORE friction than the paper surface. The higher friction on the cloth surface prevented the block from sliding as far.\n\nAccording to the task, I need to focus on the inclined plane with the most friction, which is the cloth inclined plane.\n\n>>> focus on inclined plane with a cloth surface <<<"
