Among these three animals, bears typically have the longest lifespan (around 20-30 years in the wild), while mice have very short lifespans (1-3 years) and wolves have moderate lifespans (6-8 years in the wild). Therefore, the baby baby brown bear would have the longest life span.\n\nThe task says to \"Focus on the animal with the longest life span.\"\n\n>>> focus on baby baby brown bear <<<"
