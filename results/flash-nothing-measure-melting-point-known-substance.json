I need to infer it from the game's mechanics or assume a common melting point for chocolate.\n\nThe task states: \"If the melting point of chocolate is above -10.0 degrees celsius, focus on the blue box. If the melting point of chocolate is below -10.0 degrees celsius, focus on the orange box.\"\n\nTypical chocolate melting points are well above -10 degrees Celsius (usually around 30-32 degrees Celsius). Therefore, I will assume the melting point of chocolate is above -10.0 degrees Celsius.\n\nBased on this assumption, I need to focus on the blue box.\n>>> focus on blue box <<<"
