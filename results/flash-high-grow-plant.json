This implies that the water isn't *dunked* from a basin, but *comes out of* the faucet.\n\nMaybe I need to `activate jug` with `sink`? No, jug is not a device.\n\nI'm stuck on getting water.

This means the water would be flowing into it, not stored in it.\n\nWhat if I don't need a jug to water it?

It's not a container.\n\nLet's re-examine the available actions that involve liquids:\n- `dunk OBJ in OBJ`: I tried this, and it implies a container. The sink is not a container it seems.\n- `pour OBJ in OBJ`: Requires an OBJ that *contains* liquid.
