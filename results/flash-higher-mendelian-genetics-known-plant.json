    "28": [
        "\"That can't be moved there.\" confirms that `move OBJ to OBJ` is not for planting the seed. This game is extremely difficult due to its pedantic nature and unclear action mapping.\n\nI have exhausted all logical ways to plant a seed in this game environment with the understanding of what \"planting\" means in a real-world context, and the provided actions. All the actions \"use OBJ on OBJ\", \"mix OBJ\", \"put down OBJ\", \"move OBJ to OBJ\" have failed for planting.\n\nThis implies that either:\n1. I am missing a crucial object or state change that allows planting. (e.g., soil needs \"softening\" with the shovel, or watering first).\n2. The method of planting is hidden in a non-obvious interpretation of the commands.\n3. The game has a specific, unstated requirement for planting seeds.\n\nLet's revisit the water situation. I tried \"dunk jug in sink\" after \"activate sink\" and it failed. \"The sink does not contain any liquids to dunk into.\" This is truly baffling given the need for water. Is there a \"water tap\" or \"faucet\" that needs to be \"activate\"d? No, the only available \"sink\" is the object.\n\nCould the \"jug\" itself be the problem? What if I need to use the \"ceramic cup\" to get water? No, the cup is in the living room.\n\nI have to plant the seed. What if \"soil in flower pot 4\" isn't the correct object? What if it's \"flower pot 4\" itself? I tried that and it failed.\n\nCould \"soil\" itself be an object I can manipulate without the pot? I did pick up \"soil in flower pot 1\" and it became \"soil in greenhouse\".\n\nLet's assume for a moment that planting involves \"using\" the seed. Since \"use round green pea seed on soil in flower pot 4\" consistently fails with \"I'm not sure how to use the pea seed\", it implies that the *pea seed* is the object the game is confused about on *how to use*.\n\nPerhaps the pea seed needs a pre-treatment. Is there any other object it could interact with? No other objects available seem related to seed treatment.\n\nGiven the pedantic nature, and the phrase \"I'm not sure how to use the pea seed.\" and not \"I'm not sure how to use this on that\", it's about the seed itself.\n\nCould the seed be \"read\"? No, it's a seed.\nCould I \"eat\" the seed? It's a pea seed. Perhaps this is the intended \"use\"? Extremely unlikely for a biology simulation to grow plants.\n\nLet's look at the \"living thing\" object available in the greenhouse. \"living thing\". This is extremely vague. Could I use the seed on the \"living thing\"? Like a symbiotic relationship? Highly unlikely.\n\nI'm out of obvious ideas for planting the seed. I must be missing something fundamental about the game's mechanics or the environment.\n\nWhat if \"use OBJ on OBJ\" is only for certain types of relationships?\nE.g., \"use key on door\", \"use tool on material\".\nA seed is not a tool, and soil is not a material to be processed in that sense.\n\nLet me try to consider another type of interaction. What if the **flower pot** is the object that needs to \"use\" the seed?\n\"use flower pot 4 on round green pea seed\" - this would be grammatically incorrect, but I'm desperate.\n\nLet's try \"focus on\" the seed. No, \"focus on OBJ\" does not interact.\n\nI am forced to *plant a seed*. This is the critical step.\nWhat if \"soil in flower pot\" is meant to be picked up, and then the seed is somehow combined with it, then put back? I already tried that and it didn't work.\n\nCould there be a \"seed planter\" tool I haven't found?
