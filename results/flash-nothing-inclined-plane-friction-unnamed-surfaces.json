These are the tools I need to determine which plane has more friction.\n\nTo determine friction, I will place the block on each inclined plane and observe how it slides down. The plane that causes the block to slide slower or not at all will have more friction. I can use the stopwatch to measure the time it takes for the block to slide down each plane.\n\nFirst, I will focus on the inclined plane with unknown material C.\n\n>>> focus on inclined plane with a unknown material c surface <<<"

This implies that the inclined plane with unknown material C has high friction.\n\nTo confirm this, I will now move the block to the inclined plane with unknown material H and repeat the process.
