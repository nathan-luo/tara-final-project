I can see three animals:\n1. baby baby brown bear\n2. baby baby mouse  \n3. baby baby wolf\n\nThe task asks me to find the animal with the longest life span and then focus on it. I need to determine which of these three animals has the longest life span. Generally speaking, bears typically have longer lifespans than wolves, and wolves typically have longer lifespans than mice. Brown bears can live 20-30 years in the wild, wolves around 6-8 years in the wild, and mice only 1-3 years.\n\nSo the baby baby brown bear should have the longest life span. The task says to \"focus on\" the animal with the longest life span.\n\n>>> focus on baby baby brown bear <<<"
