The block slides faster down steeper inclines due to greater gravitational component along the plane.\n\nTherefore, inclined plane B has the shallowest angle (took longer for the block to slide down).\n\nAccording to the task, I need to focus on the inclined plane with the shallowest angle, which is inclined plane B.\n\n>>> focus on inclined plane b <<<"
