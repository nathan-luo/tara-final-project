This means I can mix an object, but it doesn't specify what it can be mixed with.\n\nI have watered the plants. One is unwell (now in my inventory), the other is still a seed.\n\nI need to find a way to provide nutrients or improve the soil.\n\nI have a \"shovel\". I can \"dig\" with a shovel. The action list does not explicitly list \"dig\".\n\nI see \"soil in flower pot 1\", \"soil in flower pot 3\", etc. This means I can refer to the soil directly.\n\nWhat if I need to \"mix\" the soil with something? I don't have anything to mix.\n\nI need to find a source of nutrients. Since I can't open the bee hive, and there's no fertilizer, I'm at a loss.\n\nI have the \"unknown E plant\" (the unwell one) in my inventory. I also have the \"square blue unknown E seed\" in my inventory.\n\nI have tried to use the shovel in various ways, but it seems I cannot \"dig\" or \"mix\" the soil directly with it.\n\nLet's reconsider the \"bee hive\". It's a source of life, and bees are crucial for plants. Even if I can't open it, perhaps there's a way to interact with it.\n\nI have tried \"activate bee hive\" and \"look in bee hive\".\n\nI see \"ceramic cup\" in the available objects, but not in the room description. This might be a red herring or something I haven't found yet.\n\nI am going to try to \"mix\" the soil in flower pot 1. The error message \"That container is empty, so there are no items to mix\" suggests that I need to put something *into* the flower pot first, and then mix it.\n\nI don't have any obvious \"nutrients\" or \"fertilizer\".\n\nWhat if the \"unwell\" plant itself can be mixed? I have it in my inventory.\n\nI will try to \"put down unknown E plant in flower pot 1\". Then, I will try to \"mix unknown E plant\". This is a long shot, but I need to try something.\n\n>>> put down unknown E plant in flower pot 1 <<<"
