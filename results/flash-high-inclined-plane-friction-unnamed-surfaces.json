I have tried \"wood block\" and \"block\", with various capitalizations and phrasing.\n\nThe game is pedantic. \"use OBJ on OBJ\" implies that `OBJ` refers to an object listed in the game. I have confirmed that `block` and `inclined plane with a unknown material C surface` are listed as available objects. The issue is *why* the game states it can't use the *wood* block. It must be either:\n1. The game is specifically looking for an action that sets the block on the plane and then measures friction, and \"use\" is too generic for that.\n2. There's a hidden pre-condition for \"using\" the block on the plane.\n3. The names of the objects are subtly different from what I'm entering.\n\nLet me review the available objects again. I see \"block\" as an available object in the workshop. I also see \"inclined plane with a unknown material c surface\" and \"inclined plane with a unknown material h surface\".\n\nPerhaps the interaction is not directly \"use block on inclined plane\", but rather a combination of actions. However, nothing else seems to fit the task of *determining friction*.\n\nI will try one more time `use block on inclined plane with a unknown material c surface`. If this fails, then I will have to assume that the 'use' action is not the correct one to simulate sliding the block, and the game implicitly expects something else.\n\nGiven how pedantic the game is, I will re-read the environment description.\n\n\"This room is called the workshop. In it, you see:\n\ta wood block\n\tan inclined plane with a unknown material C surface\n\tan inclined plane with a unknown material H surface\n\ta table\"\n\nAha! The object in the room is `a wood block`, and when I picked it up, it was `wood block`. When I put it down, it was `wood block`. And the game responds \"I'm not sure how to use the wood block.\" It's consistent.\n\nSo the object I should be using is `wood block`, not `block`. My previous attempts *were* correct in using `wood block`.\n\nThe issue, then, must be a misinterpretation of \"use\" or a missing precondition.\nWhat if I need to *activate* the inclined plane or `focus` on it, and then \"use\" the block? I already tried `focus on`. There's no `activate inclined plane`.\n\nLet me look closely at the action \"use OBJ on OBJ\". Maybe it means literally 'use one object *to operate* another'. What if I need to move the block ONTO the plane? `move OBJ to OBJ`.\n\nI will try: `move wood block to inclined plane with a unknown material C surface`.
