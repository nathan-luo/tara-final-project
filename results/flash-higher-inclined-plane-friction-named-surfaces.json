I've done that, and I got '12 ticks' both times. This indicates the task is *not* about measuring actual physical sliding time.\n\n\"determine which of the two inclined planes (paper, cloth) has the most friction.\"\n\nWhat if the friction is determined by *whether* the block can be placed without sliding? The game stated \"You move the wood block to the inclined plane.\" This implies it *stays* there. It doesn't say \"the block slides off.\"\n\nWhat if the answer isn't about sliding, but about *something else* that differentiates the two surfaces related to friction? Often in ScienceWorld, if a simple physical simulation doesn't work, there's a more abstract solution or a different interpretation of the problem.\n\nGiven the list of objects, I'm in the workshop. I have a `stopwatch` and a `block`. I also have `anode`, `cathode`, `battery`, `wires`, `light bulbs`. These are for electricity circuits, which seems completely unrelated to friction.\n\nPerhaps the \"most friction\" is determined by something to do with the \"switch\" or the \"light bulbs\"? This is a long shot, but I need to consider all options. No, that doesn't make sense. The task is specifically about the inclined planes and friction.\n\nWhat if one of the planes is too steep for the block to stay? The game did not give me any such feedback.\n\nI need to reconsider the '12 ticks'. What if \"12 ticks\" means \"it took 12 ticks for the block to *overcome* friction and slide\"? If it was a real experiment, a surface with *higher* friction would result in a *longer* time or no slide at all. Both being 12 ticks would mean they have the same amount of friction, but the task implies there WILL be a difference.\n\nCould the \"stopwatch\" be a red herring? Or is the number of ticks given directly related to the friction? If so, 12 ticks for both means they have equal friction and the task is impossible as stated. This is unlikely.\n\nLet's assume there is a hidden property of \"friction\" associated with the inclined planes. How can I extract that?\n\nI performed \"look at inclined plane with a paper surface\" and \"look at inclined plane with a cloth surface\", and it only gave names.\n\nWhat if I need to *tilt* the planes? There's no command for that.\n\nCould it be that the block *doesn't* slide on one of them unless I do something specific? And if it doesn't slide, that means it has more friction.\n\nThe only way to interact with the block on the plane is `move block to inclined plane with a X surface`.\n\nI need to confirm if there is any other way to find out about friction from the game. Let me try looking at the workshop as a whole.\n\n>>> look around <<<"

There must be another property.\n\nWhat if one of the inclined planes *does not allow the block to be moved to it*?
