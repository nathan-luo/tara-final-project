This means I need to re-evaluate the source of blue paint.\n\nI will look at the `paint cupboard` now, even though I didn't find blue paint there before. Perhaps the items within the cupboards are randomized or reset.\n\n>>> look in paint cupboard <<<"

The `paint cupboard` is also empty of blue paint.\n\nLet's carefully examine the available objects again.\n- `cup containing red paint in art studio`\n- `cup containing red paint in cupboard`\n- `cup in room` (This sounds generic, might be empty)\n- `wood cup on room` (Another generic cup)\n\nThere is no blue paint cup in the direct `available objects` list, nor in the cupboards I've checked. This is highly problematic since I need blue and yellow to make green.\n\nI have not listed the contents of my inventory yet. I only know I have the bee hive, orange, and yellow paint cup.\nLet me check `inventory` again to ensure I didn't miss something.\n\n>>> inventory <<<"

This is a significant issue for the task, as the \"chemistry\" part would be bypassed.\n\nIf `green-blue paint` already exists, I cannot \"create\" it. The task clearly states \"Your task is to use chemistry to create green-blue paint.\" If I can't create it, I can't complete the task.\n\nThis game state is clearly broken from the perspective of the task. The previous successful completion of `green-blue paint` (before the \"reset task\" command) has left the object in the world.\n\nI need to confirm if this `green-blue paint` object is a physical object I can interact with, which would indicate it already exists.\n\n>>> look at green-blue paint <<<"
