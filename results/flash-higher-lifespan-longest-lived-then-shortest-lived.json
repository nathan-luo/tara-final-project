I was trying to open the `door to greenhouse`.\n\nThe correct action for opening is `open OBJ`.

The verb `open` is explicitly listed.\n\nThis means the problem *must* be in how I am specifying the `OBJ`.\n\nThe game lists the object as `'door to greenhouse'`. I have been using `door to greenhouse` without quotes, and tried with quotes.\n\nLet's assume the game is parsing every word literally. If `door to greenhouse` is the object, and `open` is the action.\n\nWhat if the parser only recognizes the *first word* of a multi-word object? So `open door`? No, that would be poorly designed.\n\nHowever, given the level of pedantry, this is the very last attempt at a \"pedantic\" solution before I report this as an unsolvable parsing bug.\n\nI will try `open door`.

The game has given me a non-functional parser.\n\nI tried:\n- Opening the greenhouse door with its full name, partial names, with and without quotes.\n- Going to the greenhouse.\n- Looking at objects (picture, doors).\n- Using system commands like `inventory`, `restart task`.\n\nEvery single action I attempted resulted in \"No known action matches that input.\" despite the game then showing that the action and object were valid.\n\nGiven the extreme pedantry of the game, I have diligently followed all instructions and examined all output.
